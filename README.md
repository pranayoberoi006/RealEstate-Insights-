## 🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ The user fills the **prediction form** (location, area, BHK, etc.).  
2️⃣ Data is sent to the **Flask backend API**.  
3️⃣ The trained **AI model** processes the data and predicts the price.  
4️⃣ The **Next.js frontend** displays the result dynamically using charts and styled components.
